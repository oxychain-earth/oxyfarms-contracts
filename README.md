# OxyFarms NFTtrees Smart Contracts

This repository contains the NFT smart contracts for the OxyFarms NFTrees project. The project will allow Oxychain to offer 4444 tokens in crowdsale with a fixed price in ETH (that can be changed along the way).
The smart contracts are structured with a whitelisting mechanism that enables a pre-sale. The funds are gathered in the smart contract and can be claimed only by the owner of the smart contract.

## About the source code

The source code in this repo is based on ([ERC-721](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-721.md) standard implemented by OpenZeppelin. The tokens here instantiated makes reference to external metadata. The URI to the external metadata is defined inside the smart contract.

## Troubleshooting

If you have any questions, send them along with a hi to hello@oxychain.earth.
